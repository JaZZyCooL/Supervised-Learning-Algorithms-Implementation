The link to the code files is as follows:

Each algorithm file is separate for each dataset

1) Within each code file there are 3 subsections (for neural network 4). They are as follows :
    
    a) The algorithm specification
    b) Learning curve
    c) Validation curve with each hyperparameter separately defined in a list
       might have to fix a particular hyperparameter and replace the hyperparameter you are trying to run in for loop with the format hyperparameter[i]
    d) -----ONLY FOR NEURAL NETWORK------------
       uncomment the last graph (#code adopted from stackoverflow)
       
       
2) Uncomment the section you wish to run and click run except for validation curve, where you might have to change the hyperparameter you are trying to run in the for loop.
